This C code is a simple billing system for a college canteen. It helps keep track of what each customer orders, calculates the bill, gives a discount if the bill is high, and finally shows the total customers and total money earned by the canteen.​
Step-by-Step Explanation

The program starts by asking how many customers there are for the day. It keeps a count of total money earned.

For each customer, it shows the menu and asks how many items the customer wants to order.

For every item order, it asks for the item code (like sandwich, pizza, etc.) and the quantity (how many).

It uses a switch-case to find out the price of each item based on the code entered.

It multiplies the price with the quantity to get the cost for that item and keeps adding to that customer's bill.

If the customer's bill is greater than ₹500, it gives a 10% discount and shows both the original and the discounted final bill.

After all customers are done, it prints how many customers were served and the total revenue collected.

This program uses loops to repeat actions for each customer and item, and it uses conditions to give a discount if the bill is high. Everything is done using simple variables and no advanced programming features.
